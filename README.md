# Harvest-Hive
***
The idea of the website is to provide a platform for farmers to get information on the crops they can grow based on the characteristics of their farm land. The website will use various technologies to provide this information, including machine learning algorithms to predict the crops that can grow in a specific area based on soil type, weather, and other factors.

To use the website, farmers can sign up and create a profile, where they can enter information about their farm land, including the location, soil type, size, and other relevant details. The website will then use this information, along with weather data and other factors, to provide recommendations on the crops that can grow well in that area.

In addition to crop recommendations, the website will also provide information on best practices for growing and managing crops, as well as market trends and pricing information for different crops. This information will help farmers make informed decisions on what crops to grow, how to manage them, and when to sell them.

Overall, the goal of the website is to help farmers increase their yields and profitability by providing them with accurate and timely information on crop selection and management.
